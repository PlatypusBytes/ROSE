# README #

ROSE consists of a software for the computation of railway track degradation.

The ROSE software simulates train-track interaction, and computes the resulting
long-term deformation caused by train traffic.

The ROSE software allows the use of data in order to improve the schematisation
and parameterisation of the model.
